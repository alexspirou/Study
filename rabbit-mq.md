## 1) RabbitMQ: exchanges, queues, bindings, routing keys, consumers (post office analogy)

**Answer:**

- **Exchange** = post office (routes)
- **Queue** = mailbox (stores)
- **Binding** = rule connecting post office ‚Üí mailbox
- **Routing key** = address on envelope (e.g., `orders.created`)
- **Consumer** = person who opens the mailbox

## 2) Direct exchange with selective routing (Billing, Shipping, Analytics)

**Answer:**  
Use a **direct exchange** and bind queues with **exact routing keys**.

### Publisher

```csharp
// Declare a direct exchange
channel.ExchangeDeclare(
    exchange: "orders-direct-exchange",
    type: ExchangeType.Direct,
    durable: true
);

void Publish(string routingKey, string message)
{
    var body = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message);

    channel.BasicPublish(
        exchange: "orders-direct-exchange",
        routingKey: routingKey,
        basicProperties: null,
        body: body
    );
}

// Example publishes
Publish(routingKey: "orders.created",   message: "Order 123 created");
Publish(routingKey: "orders.shipped",   message: "Order 123 shipped");
Publish(routingKey: "orders.cancelled", message: "Order 123 cancelled");
```

---

### Consumers

```csharp
// Billing: only created
channel.QueueDeclare(
    queue: "billing-queue",
    durable: true,
    exclusive: false,
    autoDelete: false
);
channel.QueueBind(
    queue: "billing-queue",
    exchange: "orders-direct-exchange",
    routingKey: "orders.created"
);

// Shipping: only shipped
channel.QueueDeclare(
    queue: "shipping-queue",
    durable: true,
    exclusive: false,
    autoDelete: false
);
channel.QueueBind(
    queue: "shipping-queue",
    exchange: "orders-direct-exchange",
    routingKey: "orders.shipped"
);

// Analytics: bind to ALL routing keys
channel.QueueDeclare(
    queue: "analytics-queue",
    durable: true,
    exclusive: false,
    autoDelete: false
);
channel.QueueBind(
    queue: "analytics-queue",
    exchange: "orders-direct-exchange",
    routingKey: "orders.created"
);
channel.QueueBind(
    queue: "analytics-queue",
    exchange: "orders-direct-exchange",
    routingKey: "orders.shipped"
);
channel.QueueBind(
    queue: "analytics-queue",
    exchange: "orders-direct-exchange",
    routingKey: "orders.cancelled"
);
```

## 3) Topic exchange with selective routing (Billing, Shipping, Analytics)

**Answer:**  
Use a **topic** exchange and bind queues with keys/wildcards.

![RabbitMQ Diagram](Resources\rb-mq\routing-topic.png)

**Publisher:**

```csharp
channel.ExchangeDeclare(
    exchange: "orders-exchange",
    type: ExchangeType.Topic,
    durable: true
);

void Publish(string routingKey, string message)
{
    var body = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message);
    channel.BasicPublish(
        exchange: "orders-exchange",
        routingKey: routingKey,
        basicProperties: null,
        body: body
    );
}

Publish(routingKey: "orders.created",   message: "Order 123 created");
Publish(routingKey: "orders.shipped",   message: "Order 123 shipped");
Publish(routingKey: "orders.cancelled", message: "Order 123 cancelled");
```

**Consumers:**

```csharp
// Billing: only created
channel.QueueDeclare(
    queue: "billing-queue",
    durable: true,
    exclusive: false,
    autoDelete: false
);
channel.QueueBind(
    queue: "billing-queue",
    exchange: "orders-exchange",
    routingKey: "orders.created"
);

// Shipping: only shipped
channel.QueueDeclare(
    queue: "shipping-queue",
    durable: true,
    exclusive: false,
    autoDelete: false
);
channel.QueueBind(
    queue: "shipping-queue",
    exchange: "orders-exchange",
    routingKey: "orders.shipped"
);

// Analytics: all order events
channel.QueueDeclare(
    queue: "analytics-queue",
    durable: true,
    exclusive: false,
    autoDelete: false
);
channel.QueueBind(
    queue: "analytics-queue",
    exchange: "orders-exchange",
    routingKey: "orders.*"
);
```

## 4) Fanout exchange (pub/sub broadcast)

**Answer:**  
Use a **fanout** exchange to broadcast every message to **all** bound queues.  
The routing key is ignored for fanout exchanges.

---

![RabbitMQ Diagram](Resources\rb-mq\pub-sub.png)

### Real-world Example: **User Events Broadcast**

Imagine a system where every **user event** (signup, login, profile update) must be sent to multiple services:

- **Email Service** ‚Üí sends welcome/login emails
- **Activity Feed Service** ‚Üí updates the user's feed
- **Audit Service** ‚Üí records all events for compliance

---

### Publisher

```csharp
channel.ExchangeDeclare(
    exchange: "user-events-exchange",
    type: ExchangeType.Fanout,
    durable: true
);

void Publish(string message)
{
    var body = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message);
    channel.BasicPublish(
        exchange: "user-events-exchange",
        routingKey: "",
        basicProperties: null,
        body: body
    );
}

// Example publishes
Publish(message: "User 42 signed up");
Publish(message: "User 42 logged in");
Publish(message: "User 42 updated profile");
```

---

### Consumers

```csharp
// Email Service: receives all user events
channel.QueueDeclare(
    queue: "email-service-queue",
    durable: true,
    exclusive: false,
    autoDelete: false
);
channel.QueueBind(
    queue: "email-service-queue",
    exchange: "user-events-exchange",
    routingKey: ""
);

// Activity Feed Service: receives all user events
channel.QueueDeclare(
    queue: "activity-feed-queue",
    durable: true,
    exclusive: false,
    autoDelete: false
);
channel.QueueBind(
    queue: "activity-feed-queue",
    exchange: "user-events-exchange",
    routingKey: ""
);

// Audit Service: receives all user events
channel.QueueDeclare(
    queue: "audit-service-queue",
    durable: true,
    exclusive: false,
    autoDelete: false
);
channel.QueueBind(
    queue: "audit-service-queue",
    exchange: "user-events-exchange",
    routingKey: ""
);
```

## 5) Request/Reply pattern (RPC with correlation IDs)

**Answer:**  
Use a **direct exchange** with a **reply queue**.  
The client sends a request message with a `CorrelationId` and `ReplyTo` property.  
The server processes the request and publishes the reply to the `ReplyTo` queue with the same `CorrelationId`.

---

![RabbitMQ Diagram](Resources\rb-mq\request-reply-pattern.png)

### Publisher (Client)

```csharp
// Declare request exchange
channel.ExchangeDeclare(
    exchange: "rpc-exchange",
    type: ExchangeType.Direct,
    durable: true
);

// Declare a temporary reply queue
var replyQueueName = channel.QueueDeclare().QueueName;

// Consumer to receive replies
var consumer = new EventingBasicConsumer(channel);
string correlationId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

string response = null;
consumer.Received += (model, ea) =>
{
    if (ea.BasicProperties.CorrelationId == correlationId)
    {
        response = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(ea.Body.ToArray());
        Console.WriteLine($"[Client] Received response: {response}");
    }
};

channel.BasicConsume(
    queue: replyQueueName,
    autoAck: true,
    consumer: consumer
);

// Publish request
var props = channel.CreateBasicProperties();
props.CorrelationId = correlationId;
props.ReplyTo = replyQueueName;

var messageBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("GetOrderStatus:123");
channel.BasicPublish(
    exchange: "rpc-exchange",
    routingKey: "order-service",
    basicProperties: props,
    body: messageBytes
);

Console.WriteLine("[Client] Sent request: GetOrderStatus:123");
```

---

### Consumer (Server)

```csharp
// Declare request queue
channel.QueueDeclare(
    queue: "order-service-queue",
    durable: true,
    exclusive: false,
    autoDelete: false
);
channel.QueueBind(
    queue: "order-service-queue",
    exchange: "rpc-exchange",
    routingKey: "order-service"
);

var consumer = new EventingBasicConsumer(channel);
consumer.Received += (model, ea) =>
{
    var body = ea.Body.ToArray();
    var message = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(body);
    Console.WriteLine($"[Server] Received request: {message}");

    // Simulate processing
    string responseMessage = "Order 123 is SHIPPED";

    var replyProps = channel.CreateBasicProperties();
    replyProps.CorrelationId = ea.BasicProperties.CorrelationId;

    var responseBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(responseMessage);

    // Send reply to the reply queue
    channel.BasicPublish(
        exchange: "",
        routingKey: ea.BasicProperties.ReplyTo,
        basicProperties: replyProps,
        body: responseBytes
    );

    channel.BasicAck(
        deliveryTag: ea.DeliveryTag,
        multiple: false
    );
};

channel.BasicConsume(
    queue: "order-service-queue",
    autoAck: false,
    consumer: consumer
);
```

---

‚úÖ **Result:**

- Client sends `GetOrderStatus:123` with a `CorrelationId` and `ReplyTo`.
- Server processes and replies back to the `ReplyTo` queue with the same `CorrelationId`.
- Client matches the correlation ID and reads the response.

# RabbitMQ Lifetimes & Best Practices in .NET

## üî¥ Anti-patterns to Avoid

1.  **Creating a new connection per message**
    - ‚ùå Every `factory.CreateConnection()` opens a new TCP socket and
      AMQP handshake.
    - Extremely expensive ‚Üí kills throughput.\
    - ‚úÖ Fix: create **one connection (singleton)** and reuse it for
      all channels.
2.  **Sharing one channel across multiple threads**
    - ‚ùå `IModel` (channel) is **not thread-safe**. If two threads
      publish at once, messages can get corrupted or cause protocol
      errors.
    - ‚úÖ Fix: either (a) one dedicated channel per consumer, (b) a
      pool for publishers.
3.  **Using Scoped lifetimes for AMQP primitives in web apps**
    - ‚ùå If you register `IConnection` or `IModel` as scoped, you'll
      get a new one per request (like per HTTP call).\
    - That means dozens/hundreds of connections/channels per second ‚Üí
      üí•.\
    - ‚úÖ Fix: `IConnection` as **singleton**, `IModel` managed
      explicitly (per consumer / pooled).
4.  **`autoAck: true` for anything that can fail**
    - ‚ùå Auto-ack means the broker deletes the message **before** your
      code finishes. If your handler crashes, message is lost
      forever.\
    - ‚úÖ Fix: use `autoAck: false` + call `BasicAck` **after**
      successful handling. If something goes wrong, `BasicNack` and
      retry/DLX.
5.  **Infinite requeues**
    - ‚ùå If you always `BasicNack(..., requeue: true)`, a poison
      message loops forever, hammering CPU + logs.\
    - ‚úÖ Fix: limit retries (e.g., DLX after 3--5 attempts). Use a
      retry queue with a delay before reprocessing.

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Checklist Explained

1.  **`IConnection = Singleton`**
    - One connection object per app process. Cheap to keep, expensive
      to recreate.
2.  **Channels = per consumer (long-lived) / pooled (publishers)**
    - Consumers: create one channel each, keep it open.\
    - Publishers: rent a channel from a pool, return it after
      publishing.
3.  **`DispatchConsumersAsync = true`, `ConfirmSelect()` for
    publishers**
    - `DispatchConsumersAsync` ‚Üí lets you use async/await safely in
      consumers.\
    - `ConfirmSelect()` ‚Üí publisher confirms = broker acknowledges
      that a message really reached the queue. No silent losses.
4.  **Durable exchanges/queues + persistent messages**
    - Durable = survive broker restart.\
    - Persistent messages = saved to disk, not just in RAM.\
    - Both together = reliable delivery.
5.  **Prefetch set; manual ack/nack**
    - Prefetch controls how many messages a consumer pulls before
      acking (like "max in-flight"). Prevents overload.\
    - Manual ack ‚Üí you decide when message is "done" or "retry."
6.  **Retries + DLX; idempotent handlers**
    - Retries: use retry queues with a delay (avoid hammering
      broker).\
    - DLX: Dead Letter Exchange to store poison messages after max
      retries.\
    - Idempotent handlers: safe to reprocess the same message without
      side effects.
7.  **Health checks, metrics, graceful shutdown**
    - Health: can app connect to Rabbit? Is channel alive?\
    - Metrics: consumer lag, DLX depth, confirm latency.\
    - Graceful shutdown: stop consuming, ack/nack in-flight messages,
      close channels, then close connection.
