# 🌐 ASP.NET Core Request & Response Pipeline (Realistic Example)

## Example: User fetches their orders from `/api/orders`

---

### 1. User action
- **User**: opens their laptop, types in browser:  
  `https://shop.com/api/orders`  
- **User sees**: browser tab spinning (waiting).

---

### 2. Network transport
- **Browser**: resolves DNS → opens TCP → does HTTPS handshake.  
- **User sees**: still waiting, no response yet.

---

### 3. Kestrel receives request
- **ASP.NET Core (Kestrel)**: accepts request, creates a new **`HttpContext`** object.  
  - `HttpContext.Request` now contains: method=GET, path=`/api/orders`, headers (Authorization cookie/JWT).  
- **User sees**: still waiting.

---

### 4. Middleware pipeline
- The `HttpContext` flows through middlewares in order:  
  1. **Exception handler** — ready to catch errors.  
  2. **HTTPS redirection** — not needed, already HTTPS.  
  3. **Routing** — matches `/api/orders` → `OrdersController.GetAll()`.  
  4. **Authentication** — validates the user’s JWT token.  
  5. **Authorization** — confirms user has “Orders.Read” role.  
- **User sees**: still waiting.

---

### 5. Controller execution (business logic)
- ASP.NET Core invokes `OrdersController.GetAll()`.  
- Inside this method:  
  - Reads current `HttpContext.User` → gets the logged-in username.  
  - Needs to fetch extra order data from an **external Payment API**.

---

### 6. Outbound call via `HttpClient`
- App uses **`HttpClient`** to call `https://payments.com/api/user/{id}/transactions`.  
- `HttpClient` is independent of `HttpContext`, but the app copies the **Authorization header** from the inbound request so the external service knows which user.  
- **App waits** asynchronously for the Payment API response.  
- **User sees**: browser still waiting — but now it depends on external API speed.

---

### 7. External API responds
- Payment API returns JSON with the user’s transactions.  
- `HttpClient` gives this back to your app.  
- App merges transactions with local database orders.

---

### 8. Response serialization
- Your action returns a result object (e.g., list of orders).  
- ASP.NET Core serializes it to **JSON** via `System.Text.Json`.  
- Headers like `Content-Type: application/json` are set.

---

### 9. Outbound response
- Kestrel writes JSON bytes to the TCP socket.  
- **User’s browser** receives the response, stops spinning.

---

### 10. User sees result
- Browser displays:
```json
[
  { "id": 1, "item": "Vinyl Record", "status": "shipped" },
  { "id": 2, "item": "Headphones", "status": "processing" }
]
```
- **User**: happy, clicks refresh → the whole pipeline repeats.

---

## 🔑 Mental picture
- **HttpContext** = “the incoming envelope” with the user’s request details (lives only during step 3 → 9).  
- **HttpClient** = “the courier” your app hires mid-way (step 6) to ask another system for info.  
- **User**: only sees the spinning wheel until step 9 finishes.
